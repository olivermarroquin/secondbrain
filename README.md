# Second Brain — macOS / CLI / AI Operating System

This directory is the canonical, long-term operating system
for all serious work on this Mac.

Rules:
- This structure is immutable.
- New capabilities are added by extension, not reorganization.
- Projects are resumable, git-first, and AI-readable.
- Human-authored content, AI outputs, staging, and archives are strictly separated.
- Obsidian manages ONLY 02_knowledge/.

If you are tempted to reorganize this tree:
STOP.
Add a new folder inside the appropriate top-level directory instead.

Creation date: $(date +%Y-%m-%d)
