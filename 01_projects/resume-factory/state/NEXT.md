# NEXT (Project)

## Scope
- Project: resume-factory
- Path: 01_projects/resume-factory
- Applies to: This project only

## Focus
Focus: Automate end-to-end resume tailoring, tracking, and interview prep from job descriptions

## Task #0 — State correction (always allowed)
- If this file does not accurately represent the next actions, update it before doing any other work.
- Updating NEXT.md does not require a prior commit.

## Execution Rules
- Tasks are executed top-down.
- Do not skip tasks unless explicitly marked optional.
- If a task becomes invalid, mark it as [obsolete] and explain why.
- New tasks are appended (do not insert above in-progress work).

## Next Actions Queue (this section will be empty later for AI to be able to use it)
1) Batch intake Jobs #2–#6 (create job folders + commit)
2) Batch resume generation Jobs #2–#6 (select → preview → suggest → approve → generate)
3) Batch apply Jobs #2–#6 (jobs-apply-batch → apply → mark applied)
4) Close session correctly
