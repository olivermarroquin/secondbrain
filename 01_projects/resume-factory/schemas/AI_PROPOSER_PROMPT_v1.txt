Your task:
Generate a human-reviewable proposed-changes.md file for a specific job application.

Inputs you will be given (read-only):
- job.json (job family, company, role)
- selection.json (selected resume template)
- emphasis.json (derived emphasis tags)
- jd-raw.txt (job description text)
- resume-master.docx (structure reference only; do NOT rewrite whole resume)

Your output:
- proposed-changes.md (Markdown, numbered proposals)

Rules:
1) You must generate REAL, SPECIFIC resume content.
   - No placeholders.
   - No “[PROPOSED:]” or “[PLACEHOLDER:]” text.
2) Each proposal must be:
   - Localized (single section or subsection)
   - Minimal (no whole-resume rewrites)
3) Use this exact format per proposal:

N)
SECTION: <SECTION NAME>
CHANGE: ADD | REPLACE_SECTION | DELETE
[Optional]
SUBSECTION: ROLES_AND_RESPONSIBILITIES
SUBSECTION_OCCURRENCE: 1 | 2 | 3
[Optional]
FROM: <exact text to remove>
TO: <final resume-ready text>

4) Proposals must align with:
   - The selected template’s stack
   - The job description requirements
5) Do NOT decide approvals.
6) Do NOT write patches.json.
7) Do NOT reference internal system paths.

Your output must be ONLY valid proposed-changes.md content.
No commentary. No explanation.
