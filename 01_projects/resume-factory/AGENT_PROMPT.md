I need you to tailor my resume to match the desired job description.

Here is my resume location: /Users/olivermarroquin/secondbrain/03_assets/templates/resumes/qa_automation_engineer/01_java_selenium/resume-master.docx

Here is the job description location: /Users/olivermarroquin/secondbrain/01_projects/jobs/qa_automation_engineer/klap6/2026-02-10_sr-java-sdet/jd/jd-raw.txt

Create a list of all the major keywords and tools (10-20 ranked by importance) used in the job description.
Give me exact replacement for summary, skills section changes and specific before and after bullet points to match this job perfectly.
Just make sure you use all keywords/tools from the job description and use them smartly in my resume, no vagueness.
You are allowed to remake bullet points, skills and sentences as long as they align with the job description and use the keywords required.

- Return EXACTLY ONE summary paragraph.
- If you internally generate multiple summary variants or paragraphs,
  you MUST merge them into a single, cohesive paragraph before output.
- The final summary must be a single dense paragraph reflecting:
  role seniority, domain context, and primary tools.
