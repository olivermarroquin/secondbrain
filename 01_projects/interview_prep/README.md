# Interview Prep — Coding Problems

Purpose:
Time-boxed interview preparation for coding and system questions.

Rules:
- One problem per file in /problems
- Solutions go in /solutions
- Reviews go in /reviews
- Notes are short and tactical
- Commit after each problem + review

This folder optimizes for interview performance, not completeness.
