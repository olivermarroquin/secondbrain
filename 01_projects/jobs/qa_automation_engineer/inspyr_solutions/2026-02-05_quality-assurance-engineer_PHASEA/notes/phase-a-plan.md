# Phase A Plan — Inspyr Solutions | Quality Assurance Engineer

Selected template: 02_java_playwright_migration

Why:
- JD emphasizes QA, API testing, Agile, Azure, and SQL, which align with Java + Playwright migration template.
- Resume already covers required skills; no safe gaps identified.
- Avoids introducing fabricated or low-signal edits.

Proposed edits:
- None.

Risks / assumptions:
- Assumes existing resume sufficiently demonstrates Azure and SQL exposure.
- Assumes no preference for Selenium-only profiles beyond what is already stated.

Next action:
- Approve edits: (none)
- Run Phase B command: resume-approve-edits --app <path> --force --open
