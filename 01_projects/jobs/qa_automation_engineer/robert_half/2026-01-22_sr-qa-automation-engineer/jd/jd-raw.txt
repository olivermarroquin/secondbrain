Contribute to unit test strategies; collaborate with developers to increase application-level test coverage.
Establish/enforce coding standards and conduct code reviews for QA automation initiatives.
Mentor automation engineers and promote best practices across the QA organization.
Troubleshoot and resolve blockers from automated regression suites; improve suite stability and reliability.
