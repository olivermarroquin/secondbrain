# Phase A Plan — Innominds Software | QA Automation Engineer

Selected template: 01_java_selenium

Why:
- JD emphasizes Java + Selenium as primary requirements.
- Template directly aligns with Selenium-heavy automation experience.
- No strong signal requiring Playwright or alternate stacks.

Proposed edits:
- None.

Risks / assumptions:
- Assumes existing resume sufficiently demonstrates database/SQL exposure.
- Contract-to-hire (C2H) detail is intentionally excluded from resume content.

Next action:
- Approve edits: (none)
- Run Phase B command: resume-approve-edits --app <path> --force --open
