# STATUS (Project)

## Project Identity
- Name: Resume Factory
- Path: 01_projects/resume-factory
- Type: Continuous / Long-running
- Primary owner: Oliver
- Created: 2026-01-20

## Current State
- Lifecycle phase: Design / Build / Refactor / Maintenance
- Current focus:
  - Define AI + Git collaboration workflow (RWWLO)
- Blocking issues:
  - None
- Open questions:
  - How granular should patch protocol be for AI edits?

## Active Context
- Entry point:
  - state/NEXT.md
- Current step:
  - Step 3 — Finalize repo collaboration workflow
- Last completed step:
  - Step 2 — Session rituals + state scaffolding
- Expected next transition:
  - From “Workflow definition” → “Git muscle memory drills”

## Working Agreements (Non-negotiable)
- Work from `state/NEXT.md`, not memory
- If `NEXT.md` is inaccurate, updating it is task #0
- Git-first, patch-first workflow
- No long-lived dirty working trees
- Commit state changes before ending a session

## Automation Notes (for AI / CLI)
- Read order:
  1. state/STATUS.md
  2. state/NEXT.md
  3. git log (last 10)
- Safe to automate:
  - Editing NEXT.md
  - Appending LOG.md
- Requires confirmation:
  - Structural refactors
  - Deleting files
  - Rewriting DECISIONS.md
