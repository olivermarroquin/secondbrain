# Study Zone — Interview Prep

Purpose:
This repository is a CLI-first study and interview preparation workspace.

Goals:
- Practice Java, Python, SQL, and Playwright under time pressure
- Store problems, solutions, and reviews cleanly
- Use AI via CLI to quiz, review, and guide improvements
- Keep everything Git-tracked and resumable

Rules:
- One problem per file
- Clear naming
- No hiding broken code
- Commit often with small messages

Workflow:
1) Add or select a problem from /problems
2) Solve it in the appropriate language folder
3) Run or test locally
4) Ask CLI AI to review the solution
5) Save feedback in /reviews
6) Repeat

This repo optimizes for learning speed, not perfection.
