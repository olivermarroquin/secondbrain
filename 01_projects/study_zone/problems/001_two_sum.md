# Two Sum

Category:
- Java
- Arrays / HashMap

Prompt:
Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return the indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

Return the answer in any order.

Constraints:
- Time limit: 30 minutes
- Allowed tools: standard Java (no external libraries)

Examples:
- nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9 -> [0,1]
- nums = [3,2,4], target = 6 -> [1,2]
- nums = [3,3], target = 6 -> [0,1]

Notes:
- Tests understanding of hash-based lookup and index tracking
