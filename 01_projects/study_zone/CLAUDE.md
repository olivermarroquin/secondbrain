# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Purpose

CLI-first interview preparation workspace for practicing Java, Python, SQL, and Playwright under time pressure. Optimizes for learning speed, not perfection.

## Repository Structure

- `/problems/` - Problem statements using language-specific templates
- `/java/`, `/python/`, `/sql/`, `/playwright/` - Solution files by language
- `/reviews/` - AI-generated or self-written feedback on solutions
- `/drills/` - Timed practice session logs
- `/notes/` - Study notes

## Workflow

1. Select or create a problem in `/problems/` using the appropriate template
2. Write solution in the corresponding language folder
3. Run/test locally
4. Request AI review of the solution
5. Save feedback in `/reviews/`

## Conventions

- One problem per file
- Clear naming (e.g., `001_two_sum.md`, `001_two_sum.java`)
- Commit often with small messages
- Never hide broken code—keep it visible for learning
