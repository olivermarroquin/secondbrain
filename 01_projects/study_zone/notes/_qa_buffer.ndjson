If no match is found, columns from the right table will be `NULL`.\n\n### Example\n\n**Table `Employees`**\n| ID | Name | DeptID |\n|----|-------|--------|\n| 1 | Alice | 101 |\n| 2 | Bob | 102 |\n| 3 | Charlie| NULL |\n\n**Table `Departments`**\n| ID | DeptName |\n|----|----------|\n| 101| Sales |\n| 103| Engineering|\n\n---\n\n### INNER JOIN\n`SELECT * FROM Employees INNER JOIN Departments ON Employees.DeptID = Departments.ID;`\n\n**Result:** Only Alice is returned, as she's the only employee with a `DeptID` that exists in the `Departments` table.\n| ID | Name | DeptID | ID | DeptName |\n|----|-------|--------|----|----------|\n| 1 | Alice | 101 | 101| Sales |\n\n---\n\n### LEFT JOIN\n`SELECT * FROM Employees LEFT JOIN Departments ON Employees.DeptID = Departments.ID;`\n\n**Result:** All employees are returned. Charlie, who has no department, has `NULL` for the department columns.\n| ID | Name | DeptID | ID | DeptName |\n|----|-------|--------|----|----------|\n| 1 | Alice | 101 | 101| Sales |\n| 2 | Bob | 102 | NULL| NULL |\n| 3 | Charlie| NULL | NULL| NULL |\n\n---\n\n### Interview Angles\n\n*   **Key Question:** \"Show me all records from Table A, and if there's a match in Table B, show that too.\" This immediately signals a `LEFT JOIN`. \"Show me only records that exist in both tables\" signals an `INNER JOIN`.\n*   **Finding Orphans:** A common use for `LEFT JOIN` is finding records in one table that have no corresponding record in another. The key is the `WHERE` clause:\n    ```sql\n    -- Find employees NOT in any valid department\n    SELECT E.* FROM Employees E\n    LEFT JOIN Departments D ON E.DeptID = D.ID\n    WHERE D.ID IS NULL;\n    ```\n    This query would return Bob and Charlie.\n*   **Symmetry:** `INNER JOIN` is symmetric (`A INNER JOIN B` is the same as `B INNER JOIN A`). `LEFT JOIN` is not. The order of the tables is critical."}
