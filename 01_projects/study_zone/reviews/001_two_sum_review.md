What Works:
- Correct HashMap single-pass solution returning indices
- Basic test harness prints results for sample cases

Issues:
- No validation or assertion of expected outputs in tests
- Returns empty array on no-solution despite problem guarantee; could be misleading

Improvements:
- Add assertions or simple checks for expected indices in main
- Consider throwing an exception or documenting unreachable no-solution path

Concepts to Review:
- HashMap lookup for complement
- Test assertions vs print-only checks

Next Action:
- Move On
