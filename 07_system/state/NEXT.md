# NEXT (Global)

## Task #0 (always allowed)
- If this file is not accurate, your first task is to update NEXT.md.

## Next actions (in order)
1) Finalize repo collaboration workflow (AI + Git)
   - Define patch protocol (how changes are proposed + applied)
   - Define RWWLO protocol (what files we read + commands we run)
   - Define commit strategy for state updates

2) Enforce rituals via scripts (tiny, no fancy)
   - session-start (read state, fetch safely, show status)
   - session-close (append LOG, prompt STATUS/NEXT, show status, remind commit/push)
