# Checkpoint — 2026-02-07 (Phase A complete)

## Changes since 2026-02-05

### Resume Factory
- Hardened JD term extraction to suppress salary, timezone, and location noise (e.g., 115k, az/mst, phoenix-based).

  - Inspyr Solutions — no edits required.
  - Kforce — SOA emphasis + Cypress addition proposed.
  - Innominds Software — no edits required.

### Artifacts added
