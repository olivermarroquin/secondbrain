# CURRENT (Resume Factory)

Date: 2026-02-09

Focus now:
- Validate resume-suggest-edits output quality on weak JDs without nuking signal.
- Ensure EDUCATION never leaks into SKILLS targeting/anchors.
- Keep prompt-driven freedom; avoid hard guardrails in code unless structural safety.

State:
- main is updated with: EDUCATION excluded from SKILLS section parsing; rewrite behavior stabilized; notes bundles recorded.
- LATEST.md should point to today’s checkpoint after rf-checkpoint runs.

Next:
- Re-run resume-suggest-edits on 1–2 real JDs (not tool-list-only) and compare diffs for signal retention.
